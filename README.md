# ‚öΩ Football Transfer Market Analysis & Player Value Prediction  

## üìå Introduction  
This project aims to analyze the **football transfer market** across multiple teams and leagues for **two seasons (2021-2022 and 2022-2023)**. By exploring **player performances, market value fluctuations, transfer trends, and injury impacts**, we gain insights into how player valuations evolve over time.  

### The project consists of two main components:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **A global transfer market analysis** that examines **player valuations, transfer trends, and the impact of injuries on market value**. Additionally, a **predictive model** is built to estimate **player market values** based on various attributes such as **age, position, match performance, injury history, and past transfers**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **An interactive Streamlit dashboard for Real Madrid** that focuses specifically on **visualizing and analyzing the performance, transfers, and market value trends of Real Madrid players**.  

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning**, this project provides **valuable insights for football analysts, scouts, club managers, and sports economists** to better understand **transfer market dynamics and player valuation**.
